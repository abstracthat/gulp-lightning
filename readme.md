My front-end development gulpfile. Used in the [Site Lightning](http://github.com/abstracthat/sitelightning) front-end development boilerplate.

This is pretty specific to my workflow for now. I may make it more modular in the future. If you want to use it, you have to use the folder structure in Site Lightning and use this in your project's `gulpfile.js`.

```js
require('gulp-lightning')(require('gulp'));
```
